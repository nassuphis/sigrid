## Trasquera 6 (Misty Day), 2024

oil on canvas, 87 x 120 cm


In this misty landscape, the artist captures the ethereal beauty of foggy surroundings. 
Indistinct shapes of trees and bushes blend into the soft, muted tones of the background. 
The simple fence provides structure to the scene. 
This painting evokes a dreamlike quality, reflecting the transient nature of the mist.
