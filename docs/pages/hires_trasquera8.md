## Trasquera 8 (Winter Day), 2023
 
oil on canvas, 120 x 87 cm
 
This monochromatic scene illustrates a winter landscape enveloped in fog. 
The skeletal trees stand stark against the soft, misty background. 
The restrained palette and minimalist composition emphasize the quiet beauty of the snow-covered terrain. 
The painting captures the stillness and calm of a wintry day.
