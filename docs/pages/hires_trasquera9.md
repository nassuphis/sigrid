oil on canvas, 120 x 90 cm


A tranquil winter scene in a dense forest. Leafless trees with snow-covered branches stand out against 
a pale sky. The forest floor is blanketed in untouched snow, creating a peaceful and serene atmosphere. 
The composition invites contemplation, capturing the quiet beauty of a winter's day.
