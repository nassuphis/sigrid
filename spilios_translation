Absence

The act of painting is moving on the surface and is driving with grace, force and
passion in the depth of emotions. It hides and reveals simultaneously. It transforms
into an ideal means of expression, a brush of self-help and auto-salvation once life
has revealed its ugly face. A very beneficial act of the suffering soul is considered
to be, when the words lose their meaning. The movement of the brush, an
extension of the hand, the mind and the heart, could unwind the weight the artist
carries and it could create its own world that the artist would like to share with the
others.
The works of Sigrid Nassoufis, oil on canvas, are creations that were started after
the death of her husband. In mourning, relatives and friends repeat the sentence “I
have no words”. Sigrid left the words aside – the words are driven into like nails –
and created a series of landscapes, with photograph as a helper and memory as a
guide. She painted the absence. The beauty is existing, the harmony is calming, the
absence of people is meaning. Shadows and light, calmness and threat. Nature has
a perspective when people are gone. It is consoling in its greatness and beauty.
As if she says: “I search for you in places that look immortal. Here, look at the
mountains; once you left, I went there with our sons”.
The high mountains she loved, that Sigrid walked and is walking, in her eighth
decade of life, are the link with her life. With the colours and paintbrushes as
guides, she carves a path. What the beautiful wooden fences, in front of the
imposing mountain masses, cannot close.
